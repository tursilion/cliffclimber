This game was originally written in TI BASIC by Mike Brent (Ward) in 1987.

In 1993 it was updated by Lucie Dorais and Jeff Brown of the Ottawa TI User Group for Extended BASIC.

This game was compiled from TI BASIC/TI EXTENDED BASIC by TMOP in 2020.

The archive contains the Extended BASIC version as a TIFILES file and a DSK image (DSK1.CLIFFCLIMB).
It also contains a 16k non-inverted ROM image for cartridge play.
